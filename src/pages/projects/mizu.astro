<ProjectPage metadata={metadata}>
    <p>
        I led a four-person team to create MIZU, a popular anime trading card
        game on Discord. In this role, I was responsible for the full lifecycle
        of the application: designing the core architecture, building the
        application with Node.js and TypeScript, and deploying it on a
        self-managed VPS. We successfully scaled to serve over 4,000 players.
        Although MIZU is no longer active, it was a significant experience in
        leading a team and scaling a live application.
